            Color, made up of hue, saturation, and value, dispersed over a surface is the essence of painting, just as pitch and rhythm are the essence of music.<br>
             Color is highly subjective, but has observable psychological effects, although these can differ from one culture to the next.<br>
              Black is associated with mourning in the West, but in the East, white is. <br>
              Some painters, theoreticians, writers and scientists, including Goethe,[3] Kandinsky,[4] and Newton,[5] have written their own color theory.
